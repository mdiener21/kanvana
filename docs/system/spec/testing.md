# Testing

## Standard Test Stack

- `Vitest` for unit tests in `tests/unit/`
- `Vitest` plus `@testing-library/dom` for DOM integration tests in `tests/dom/`
- `MSW` for mocked API behavior shared by Vitest suites in `tests/mocks/`
- `Playwright` for end-to-end, visual, and accessibility smoke tests in `tests/e2e/`

The canonical folder and naming conventions live in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

## Test Scripts

- `npm test` - run unit, DOM, and E2E suites in sequence
- `npm run test:unit` - run unit tests only
- `npm run test:dom` - run DOM integration tests only
- `npm run test:e2e` - run Playwright only
- `npm run test:ui` - open Playwright UI mode
- `npm run test:debug` - run Playwright debug mode

## IDB Unit Test Setup

Storage tests are split across two files:

- `tests/unit/storage.test.js` — synchronous unit tests for all CRUD functions (work entirely against in-memory state, no IDB interaction needed)
- `tests/unit/storage-idb.test.js` — async tests for IDB-specific paths that `storage.test.js` cannot exercise:
  - `initStorage()` loading state from a real (fake-IDB) database
  - Multi-board and legacy single-board localStorage → IDB migration
  - Cross-session persistence: write in session A, reload in session B
  - `deleteBoard` cleaning up IDB entries
  - Cross-board read helpers (`loadTasksForBoard`, `loadColumnsForBoard`, etc.)
  - Corrupt IDB resilience

### IDB test infrastructure

- `fake-indexeddb` (dev dep) polyfills `globalThis.indexedDB` in Node.js via `tests/unit/setup.js` (`import 'fake-indexeddb/auto'`).
- `beforeEach` in `storage-idb.test.js` calls `resetLocalStorage()` (which calls `_resetStorageForTesting()`) **and** `await deleteDB('kanvana-db')` to give each test a completely empty database.
- `_resetStorageForTesting()` calls `_db.close()` before nulling `_db` so `deleteDB()` is never blocked by an open connection.
- `_flushPersistsForTesting()` awaits `Promise.all([..._pendingPersists])` before cross-session assertions; avoids timing races from fire-and-forget IDB writes.

### Cross-session roundtrip pattern

```js
await initStorage();
ensureBoardsInitialized();
saveTasks([{ id: 't1', title: 'Persisted task', ... }]);
await _flushPersistsForTesting();      // wait for IDB writes to settle
const boardId = getActiveBoardId();
_resetStorageForTesting();             // drop in-memory state; IDB intact
await initStorage();                   // reload from IDB (new session)
setActiveBoardId(boardId);
expect(loadTasks().some(t => t.title === 'Persisted task')).toBe(true);
```

## Current Coverage Focus

- Board management flows
- Task creation and validation
- Drag-and-drop performance into Done with large fixture boards
- Done-column virtualization behavior
- Swim lane rendering, settings persistence, and lane-aware moves
- IDB storage: cross-session persistence, migration, and data integrity

## Performance Coverage

- Dragging into Done with 300+ completed tasks targets sub-second drops
- Multiple consecutive drops target an average below 800ms
- Fixture data lives under `tests/fixtures/`
